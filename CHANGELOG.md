### Added
- This changelog.
- Merged #1, libatomic1 now a dependency from [@thomashilzendegen](https://github.com/thomashilzendegen).
- Default to C.UTF-8 so `dropbox status` shows correctly.

### Changed
- Base debian:jessie to ubuntu:bionic (newer and smaller image size).
- Use pgp.key-server.io instead of pgp.mit.edu, as the latter is down.
